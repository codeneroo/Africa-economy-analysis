# Africa-economy-analysis
This code is about the Africa economy outlook, their GDP growth, real per capital GDP growth rate etc. We later dropped the other Africa countries leaving ony Nigeria for this analysis.We did data.shape to know the number of rows and columns, dataset.describe to know the statistical representation of the dataset. We transposed the data to make rows become columns and columns to become rows.we then filled in the missing values and finally, we carried out a multi linear regression to train our model to predict the inflation rate in Nigeria given the dataset.
